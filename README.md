#svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


##Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

#Install and set up the Track My Hobby project
We will use degit, a project scaffolding tool, to create the application’s skeleton code using Svelte. To get started, all you need to do is open a command prompt and use the following command:

npx degit sveltejs/template hobby
This will create a basic Svelte application code structure under the directory ‘hobby’. Please browse to this directory and use the following command to install the required dependencies.

npm install # or yarn install
It may take a while to install the dependencies. Once you’re done, use the following command to run the skeleton app locally:

npm run dev # or yarn dev
Now you should see the message in your command prompt confirming the application is ready, and it is running locally on [<https://localhost:5000>](<https://localhost:5000>) by default.

How will the project look??
